new client,After a full day of suffering intense‚Ä¶,I really enjoyed my massage especially in the comfort of my own home
Megan Sims,I've used Blys a few times over the‚Ä¶,"After a full day of suffering intense panic attacks, it was 6pm and I urgently wanted a massage at home to help me calm down, my alternative was to drive myself to ED. Instead I just googled ""urgent massage at home"" and Blys was the first to pop up and as an added bonus, they had Afterpay as a payment option. I saw they had therapists available until 11pm so I quickly submitted my details and within about 30 seconds (or less), I received a text confirming who my therapist was and that they will be attending at 7.30pm. Once I received those details I had to go back into the app to confirm the booking and seamlessly made my payment using Afterpay. I received a notification at 7pm that my therapist was on his way and I even had the option to track his location. Once he arrived, he was extremely polite, professional and understanding of my situation. The massage was excellent. He was very knowledgeable and is obviously extremely skilled in the field. Excellent communication and customer-service skills and great at-home client etiquette. I still have work to do on my anxiety but I woke up today feeling less anxious and had an excellent night sleep. This is an excellent app and I have no reason not to use it again. Thank you"
customer,Would highly recommend this app!,I've used Blys a few times over the past few years and always fantastic
Seb Harper,Great massage and app is clear,Would highly recommend this app!
francesco,best massage ever thank you,I work 12 hour days and finding the time to call and book a massage let alone drive our of your way to attend their parlour becomes quite difficult. Blys allows you to place an order online via an application on your phone and the massage therapist arrives to your home with all equipment necessary. Selecting the type of massage and time is incredibly easy and you can also track your therapist when they are on their way. If you wish to see the therapist upon last visit you have the ability to save them and rebook which is fabulous! I am currently pregnant and it is superb being able to book some again who knows your body.

Due to having a sport injury i needed the massage and my normal therapist was unwell. I had to leave work to get the card details, only to be informed ""that everything is ok, we found your payment details."" A classic example of your staff failing in their diligence at the customers expense."

"Paul Watkins, Allawah....customer",Thank you for this opportunity.I‚Ä¶,Great professional service!!
Jodi,KC was a fantastic therapist,"Thank you for this opportunity.I received a relaxing massage through Blys; I think last year. As I have limited funds, every relaxation experience counts. Pleased with my previous experience, I ordered another Swedish Relaxation from Blys massage - for 90 minutes. I ticked the appropriate box, requesting a female therapist, as I did last time. The therapist arrived at my home punctually - a young man. It was not what I requested on the website! When I expressed my disappointment, the young man contacted his office to relate the disappointment on my behalf. I was told, via phone, that I ticked the inappropriate box. I maintain I certainly did not. I was then told from the office, that if I didn't go ahead with the treatment, I would still have to pay the fee. My treatments are, because of limited finances, few and far between; and I go to great deal of trouble in my home studio to provide a pleasant environment for both me and the therapist. In spite of the young man being pleasant and efficient, I was extremely disappointed - the treatment was NOT what I requested. Unfortunately, once Blys has my money, there is nothing I can do. I told the woman at the office that it would be my last order with Blys. No stars from me.!"
Nicole,Joanne was amazing as well,KC was a fantastic therapist. She knew how to work on the areas that needed it most. Booked her for a second visit straight away. Highly recommend.

MARC,"Met our expectations, we'd use Blys again","We booked blys off a Facebook ad with a days notice for a couples massage and were matched with masseuses quickly. I was a bit nervous about how the experience would play out esp as it didn't quite follow the steps noted on the website (there was no trigger when they were on their way). However with 5 minutes until start time, both turned up, set up quickly and everything else mostly met expectations. The music was off a phone (so next time I'd grab our speaker) but the guys were both fantastic and we were really happy. They even went a few minutes over to make sure we got the full-time slot. We will use Blys again."

customer,"Good massage, poor customer service",The massage service is usually good but the support system and customer service leaves a lot to be desired. I feel the support is offshored outside of Australia as it is hard to communicate with the workers and there has been a long delay between emails. I will revise my rating if I feel the customer service improves. I also had trouble booking a massage several times as no masseuse could be found.
Sergey V,Great app,Rating changed to 3 as issue was finally resolved after the founder intervened.
